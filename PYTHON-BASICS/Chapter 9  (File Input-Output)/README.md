## 📌 Overview
This chapter introduces **File Input/Output (File I/O)**, which allows Python programs to store and retrieve data from non-volatile storage such as files on disk.

File I/O is essential for building programs that require data persistence beyond program execution.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 1. Files and Data Persistence
Key concepts:
- Difference between volatile (RAM) and non-volatile storage
- Why files are required for permanent data storage
- Role of files in real-world applications

---

### 2. File Operations
Python supports multiple file operations, including:
- Reading data from files
- Writing data to files
- Appending data without overwriting existing content

---

### 3. File Handling Concepts
Important aspects of file handling:
- File modes (read, write, append)
- Opening and closing files safely
- Managing system resources effectively

---

### 4. Best Practices
- Always close files after use
- Handle files carefully to avoid data loss
- Use clear file naming conventions
- Avoid unnecessary file reads and writes

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- File I/O enables permanent data storage
- Proper file handling is critical for stability
- File-based operations are foundational for real-world applications
