                              FILE INPUT / OUTPUT (FILE I/O)
                        ==========================================

 RAM is volatile memory: all data is lost when a program ends or the system shuts down.
 To store data permanently, programs use files stored on non-volatile storage.

 A file is a structured collection of data stored on HDD or SSD.
 Python interacts with files using File Input/Output (File I/O) operations.

 File I/O allows a program to:
            - Read data from a file into memory
            - Write data from memory to a file
            - Append data without overwriting existing content

 PROGRAM <--> FILE DATA FLOW:

        Write
  Program  ----------->  File
     ↑                     ↓
     -------- Read ---------

 MEMORY VS STORAGE:
            - RAM  : Volatile, temporary, fast
            - HDD/SSD : Non-volatile, permanent, slower than RAM

 WHY FILE I/O IS IMPORTANT:
            - Preserves data after program termination
            - Enables data sharing between programs
            - Supports large datasets beyond RAM limits
            - Essential for real-world applications (logs, configs, databases)

 Any serious software uses File I/O.
 Programs without persistence are limited and often impractical.
