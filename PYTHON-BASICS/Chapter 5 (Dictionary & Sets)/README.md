## 📌 Overview
This chapter introduces **Dictionaries** and **Sets**, two core Python data structures used for efficient data storage, lookup, and uniqueness management.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 1. Dictionaries
Dictionaries store data in **key–value pairs** and are optimized for fast lookups.

Key characteristics:
- Unordered (logically), mutable
- Keys must be unique and immutable
- Values can be of any data type

Common use cases:
- Mapping relationships
- Structured data representation

---

### 2. Sets
Sets store **unique, unordered** elements and automatically remove duplicates.

Key characteristics:
- Unordered and mutable
- Does not allow duplicate values
- Supports mathematical set operations

Common use cases:
- Removing duplicates
- Membership testing
- Set operations (union, intersection)

---

### 3. Best Practices
- Use **dictionaries** for structured, labeled data
- Use **sets** when uniqueness matters
- Avoid sets when order or indexing is required

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- Dictionaries enable fast key-based access
- Sets enforce uniqueness efficiently
- Correct data structure choice improves performance and clarity
