## 📌 Overview
This chapter focuses on **conditional expressions**, which control program flow by executing different code paths based on conditions.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 1. Conditional Statements
Conditional statements evaluate expressions and decide which block of code should run.

Key concepts:
- Decision-making based on conditions
- Boolean logic evaluation
- Sequential condition checking

---

### 2. Types of Conditions
Python supports multiple forms of condition checks:

- `if` statements  
- `if–else` statements  
- `if–elif–else` chains  
- Nested conditions  

---

### 3. Best Practices
- Keep conditions clear and readable
- Avoid deeply nested condition blocks
- Use meaningful variable names for clarity
- Prefer explicit logic over complex expressions

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- Conditionals control program behavior
- Logical clarity is more important than compact syntax
- Well-structured conditions improve maintainability
