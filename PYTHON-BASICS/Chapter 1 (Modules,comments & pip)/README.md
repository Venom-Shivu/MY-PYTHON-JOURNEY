## 📌 Overview
This chapter covers the core building blocks of Python development: **modules**, **comments**, and **pip**.  
These concepts are essential for writing reusable, readable, and scalable Python programs.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 1. Modules
Modules are Python files that contain reusable code.

- **Built-in Modules**: Available by default (e.g., `os`, `math`, `random`)
- **External Modules**: Installed using pip (e.g., `numpy`, `pandas`)

Example:
```python
import math
print(math.sqrt(16))
````

### 2. Comments

Comments are ignored by the interpreter and are used to improve code clarity.

* **Single-line**: `# comment`
* **Multi-line / Docstrings**: `''' comment '''` or `""" comment """`

Use comments to explain *why* logic exists, not what obvious code does.

### 3. Pip

`pip` is Python’s package manager used to install and manage external libraries.

Common commands:

```bash
pip install package_name
pip uninstall package_name
pip list
```

## ✅ Key Takeaways

* Modules enable code reuse
* Comments improve readability and maintenance
* pip allows access to Python’s ecosystem
