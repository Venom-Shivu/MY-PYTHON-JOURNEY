## 📌 Section Overview
This section covers the **core fundamentals of Python** that every developer must master before moving on to advanced topics such as **Object-Oriented Programming, Data Analytics, or Automation**.

The chapters focus on:
- Syntax and program structure
- Core data types and data handling
- Logic building and control flow
- Reusable and modular programming
- Basic file handling and persistence

## 🧠 What You Will Learn

### 1. Python Syntax & Execution
How Python interprets code, uses indentation, and executes programs line by line.

### 2. Data Handling
Efficiently storing and manipulating data using Python’s built-in data structures.

### 3. Logic & Control Flow
Building decision-making logic using **conditionals and loops**.

### 4. Modular Programming
Writing reusable, maintainable code using **functions and recursion**.

### 5. Data Persistence
Working with files to read and store data beyond program execution.

## 🚀 Next Step
After completing this section, you should be comfortable reading and writing basic Python programs independently.

The natural progression from here is:

## 🧱 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

👉 **Go to [Object Oriented Programming](../OBJECT%20ORIENTED%20PROGRAMMING)**
