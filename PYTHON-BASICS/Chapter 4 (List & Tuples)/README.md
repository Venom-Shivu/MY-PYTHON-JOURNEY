## 📌 Overview
This chapter introduces **Lists** and **Tuples**, two fundamental sequence data types in Python used to store and manage collections of data.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 1. Lists
Lists are **ordered and mutable** collections that allow modification of elements after creation.  
They are suitable for data that changes frequently.

Key characteristics:
- Ordered and indexed
- Allows duplicates
- Supports modification

---

### 2. Tuples
Tuples are **ordered and immutable** collections.  
Once created, their values cannot be changed.

Key characteristics:
- Ordered and indexed
- Fixed and read-only
- Useful for maintaining data integrity

---

### 3. Lists vs Tuples (Best Practices)
- Use **lists** when data needs to be updated
- Use **tuples** for fixed or constant data
- Tuples are safer for critical, unchanging values

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- Lists provide flexibility
- Tuples ensure stability
- Choosing the right structure improves code quality
