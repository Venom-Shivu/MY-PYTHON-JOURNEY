![Banner](https://img.shields.io/badge/Chapter_7-Loops_in_Python-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white)

## 📌 Overview
This chapter focuses on **loops**, which are used to execute a block of code repeatedly.  
Loops are fundamental for automation, data processing, and efficient program flow control.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 1. While Loop
Repeats a block of code **as long as a condition remains true**.

---

### 2. For Loop

Used to **iterate over sequences** such as lists, strings, and ranges.

---

### 3. range() Function

Generates a sequence of numbers, commonly used with `for` loops.

---

### 4. Loop Control Statements

Used to control loop execution.

* `break` → exits the loop immediately
* `continue` → skips the current iteration
* `pass` → acts as a placeholder

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

* Loops reduce code repetition
* `for` loops handle sequences efficiently
* Control statements modify loop behavior
