 # The output will be like 23 if the input numbers were 2 & 3,
 #  this is because input syntax takes values as string.
# The '+' between the strings conactinate them.
# "Shivu"+"Coder"n willn return as ShivuCoder, similarly "1"+"2" return 12int(
# by putting the int with input will make this as intger and the summ will be performed.
