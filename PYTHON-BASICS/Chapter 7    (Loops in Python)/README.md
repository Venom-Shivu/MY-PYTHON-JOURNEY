## 📌 Overview
This chapter explains **loops**, which are used to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition or sequence.  
Loops are essential for automation, iteration, and efficient program flow.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 1. Loop Types
Python provides multiple looping constructs for different use cases:

- `for` loops for iterating over sequences
- `while` loops for condition-based repetition

---

### 2. Loop Control Statements
Control statements alter the normal flow of a loop:

- `break` to terminate a loop early
- `continue` to skip the current iteration
- `pass` as a placeholder statement

---

### 3. Best Practices
- Avoid infinite loops unless explicitly required
- Keep loop conditions clear and predictable
- Minimize nested loops to improve readability and performance

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- Loops reduce code repetition
- Proper loop control improves efficiency
- Clean loop structure leads to maintainable code
