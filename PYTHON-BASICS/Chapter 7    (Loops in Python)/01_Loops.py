                #LOOPS IN PYTHON
# A loop is type of control that makes the code to execute repeatedly until a certain condition is met.
# In Pytthon we have two types of loops:
    #1. FOR Loop
    #2. WHILE Loop

#1. FOR LOOP:
      # The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string) or other iterablle objects.
# Syntax of For Loop:
for i in range(1,6):
    print(i)
    #Output: 1 2 3 4 5 ( each nummber in new line )
