## 📌 Overview
This chapter focuses on **functions** and **recursion**, which are used to organize code, improve reusability, and solve problems by breaking them into smaller parts.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 1. Functions
Functions are reusable blocks of code designed to perform a specific task.

Key concepts:
- Code reusability and modularity
- Parameters and return values
- Function scope and lifetime

---

### 2. Recursion
Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem.

Key concepts:
- Base case and recursive case
- Stack-based execution
- Problem decomposition

---

### 3. Best Practices
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use clear and descriptive function names
- Always define a valid base case in recursion
- Avoid unnecessary recursion when iteration is simpler

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- Functions improve structure and maintainability
- Recursion simplifies certain problem types
- Clean function design leads to readable code
