## 📌 Overview
**Perfect Guess** is a command-line number guessing game built in Python using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.  
The game generates a random number based on difficulty level and evaluates user performance by tracking attempts and maintaining a persistent high score.

This project focuses on **clean structure, validation, and persistence**, not a basic script-style implementation.
