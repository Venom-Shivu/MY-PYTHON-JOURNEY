This is a great project for practicing conditional logic (`if-elif-else`) and the `random` module in Python.

# 🎮 Stone, Paper, Scissors (Python)

A classic, interactive command-line game built using Python. Challenge the computer and see who wins!

## 📜 Project Description

This is a simple implementation of the "Stone, Paper, Scissors" game. The user plays against the computer, which makes its choice randomly using Python's `random` library.

## 🛠️ Features

* **User vs. Computer:** Play against an automated opponent.
* **Input Validation:** Handles case-insensitive inputs (e.g., "Stone", "stone", and "STONE" all work).
* **Randomized AI:** The computer's move is unpredictable.

## 🚀 How to Play

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can check by running:

```bash
python --version

```

### 2. Run the Game

1. Save the game code in a file named `game.py`.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python game.py

```

### 3. Rules of the Game

The winner is decided based on these standard rules:

* **Stone** beats **Scissors** (Stone crushes Scissors).
* **Paper** beats **Stone** (Paper covers Stone).
* **Scissors** beat **Paper** (Scissors cut Paper).
* If both choose the same, it is a **Tie**.

## 🕹️ Instructions

1. When prompted, type your choice: `Stone`, `Paper`, or `Scissors`.
2. The computer will instantly reveal its choice.
3. The result (Win, Loss, or Tie) will be displayed on the screen.
4. To exit the game, use `Ctrl + C` or follow the in-game exit prompts (if added).

## 📂 File Structure

* `game.py`: The main Python script containing the game logic.
* `README.md`: Instructions and documentation (this file).
