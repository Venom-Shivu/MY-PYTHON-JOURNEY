# 🎮 Stone, Paper, Scissors — Python Console Game

A command-line implementation of the classic **Stone, Paper, Scissors** game in Python.  
This project demonstrates **two different decision-making approaches**, progressing from readable conditional logic to an optimized mathematical solution.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The game allows a user to play against the computer, which selects its move randomly using Python’s built-in `random` module.  
The project is designed to practice **conditional logic, randomness, input validation, and algorithmic optimization**.

---

## 🧠 Game Logic Approaches

### 🔹 Method 1: Conditional Logic (`if-elif-else`)
- Uses explicit conditions to compare user and computer choices.
- Prioritizes **readability and clarity**.
- Suitable for beginners learning control flow.

### 🔹 Method 2: Modular Arithmetic (Optimized)
- Represents moves numerically:
  - Rock = 0, Paper = 1, Scissors = 2
- Determines the winner using:
  ```python
  (computer_choice - user_choice) % 3
````

* Eliminates long conditional chains.
* Demonstrates **efficient and scalable decision logic**.

## ✨ Features

* User vs Computer gameplay
* Randomized computer choice
* Input validation for safe execution
* Clean, structured code
* Replay support (in enhanced version)
* Two alternative logic implementations

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites

Ensure Python 3 is installed:

```bash
python --version
```

### Run the Game

```bash
python game.py
```
