## 📌 Overview
This chapter introduces **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, a programming paradigm that organizes code using **objects** and **classes**.  
OOP helps model real-world entities, improves code reusability, and supports scalable program design.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 1. Classes and Objects
- **Class**: A blueprint that defines properties and behavior.
- **Object**: An instance of a class with its own data.

---

### 2. Attributes and Methods
- **Attributes** represent the state (data) of an object.
- **Methods** define the behavior (functions) of an object.

---

### 3. The `self` Parameter
- Refers to the current instance of a class.
- Used to access instance attributes and methods.
- Required for distinguishing object-specific data.

---

### 4. Constructors (`__init__`)
- Automatically executed when an object is created.
- Used to initialize object attributes.
- Ensures objects start in a valid state.

---

### 5. Access Modifiers
- **Public**: Accessible from anywhere.
- **Private (`__variable`)**: Intended for internal class use.
- Supports encapsulation and data protection.

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- OOP organizes code into reusable structures
- Objects combine data and behavior
- Proper initialization improves program reliability
