## 📌 Section Overview
At this stage, basic and procedural Python is no longer sufficient.  
As applications grow, code must handle **complexity, scalability, and change**.

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** provides a structured way to design software by organizing code around **objects that combine data and behavior**, closely mirroring real-world systems.

This section introduces OOP concepts as they are used in **real Python projects**, not just academic examples.

## 📂 Chapters Included

| Chapter | Topic |
| :---: | :--- |
| **10** | Object-Oriented Programming Fundamentals |
| **11** | Inheritance & Advanced OOP Concepts |

## 🧠 What is Object-Oriented Programming?
Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm where software is built using **classes** and **objects**.

Core ideas:
- A **class** defines a blueprint
- An **object** is an instance of that blueprint
- Data and behavior are bundled together
- Programs are designed for **reuse, extension, and maintainability**

OOP is not about syntax — it is about **design discipline**.

## 🔍 OOP vs Functional Programming

| Aspect | Functional / Procedural | Object-Oriented |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Code Organization | Functions | Classes & Objects |
| Data Handling | External to logic | Encapsulated |
| Scalability | Limited | High |
| Real-world Modeling | Weak | Strong |
| Long-term Maintenance | Difficult | Structured |

**Reality check:**  
OOP is not always better. It is better **when the problem requires structure and long-term growth**.

## 🧩 Core OOP Concepts Covered
This section focuses on practical Python OOP concepts, including:

- Classes and Objects  
- Constructors (`__init__`)  
- Instance vs Class variables  
- Methods and the `self` keyword  
- Encapsulation  
- Inheritance and Method Overriding  
- Polymorphism  
- Abstraction fundamentals  
- Property decorators and special methods  

Each topic is taught with **clear intent and real usage patterns**, not theory alone.

## 🌍 Why OOP Matters in Real Projects
OOP becomes essential when:

- Multiple entities interact
- Code must be reused and extended safely
- Changes should not break existing logic
- Teams collaborate on the same codebase

This is why OOP dominates:
- Backend frameworks
- Desktop applications
- Game engines
- Enterprise systems

---

## 🏁 Final Note
Object-Oriented Programming is a **tool**, not a rule.

Use it when:
- Structure, scalability, and maintainability matter

Avoid it when:
- Writing small, disposable scripts

Mastery comes from knowing **when to apply OOP — and when not to**.
